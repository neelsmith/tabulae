# Irregular forms


In a `tabulae` dataset,  the directory `irregulars`  contains irregular forms.  Irregular forms are any forms that cannot be created by pairing a regular stem with a regular ending.  You can add `.cex` files to the following subdirectories:


-   adjectives
-   adverbs
-   infinitives
-   nouns
-   participles
-   pronouns
-   verbs (conjugated forms)
