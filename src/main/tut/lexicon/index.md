layout: page

In a `tabulae` dataset, the directory `stems-tables` contains the lexicon of stems for all words in your corpus that combine with regular endings.



There are five subdirectories where you can add `.cex` files:


-   [`indeclinables`](indeclinables). For all indeclinable forms (prepositions, conjunctions, exclamations)
-   `adjectives`.  Note that regularly formed adverbs are built from these stems, too.
-   `nouns`
-   `verbs-simplex`
-   `verbs-compound`
