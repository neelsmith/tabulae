# `tabulae` #

A system for building Latin morphological parsers.

`tabulae` makes it possible to build corpus-specific Latin morphological parsers from tabular data for inflectional rules and for vocabulary ("stems").  It's a Latin sibling of [`kanones`](https://github.com/neelsmith/kanones):  like `kanones`, its aim is to build corpus-specific morphological analyzers, identifying citable lexical items and citable inflectional rules for each analysis.
